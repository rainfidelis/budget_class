## Budget Class
The budget class that instantiates different budget categories. 
Categories all have the same functionality available to them. This includes the ability to:
+ Deposit/add to a budget category
+ Withdraw from a budget category
+ Transfer from one category to another

To instantiate a category, the only required argument is the desired category name. This creates a new budget category in that name, with all the functions of the Budget class.

## Budget App
The budget_app.py demonstrates a use case of the budget class. It creates a category-based wallet app that enables users increase/decrease/transfer from existing wallet categories. 

Users will also be able to create new categories by simply supplying the name they wish to name the new category.
